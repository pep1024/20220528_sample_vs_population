## Goal

Explain how to analyze A/B test in a finite size population.

## Context

Most analysis in Statistics assume we reach conclusions from samples
obtained from an infinite size population or, at least, that the size of the 
population is much greater than the size of the sample/s. A/B test paradigm 
consists in taking two samples from an infinite (at least theoretically) 
population, give to one of them a different treatment and analyse if there is
a significant difference in the metric the treatment impacts. Usually,
the population behind the samples is not explicitly mentioned. This is precisely
the focus of this note: Identify in each experiment the population we are
trying to reach conclusions about and show how hypothesis testing methodologies
may depend on the population we choose. 

## A toy example

Assume a callege with two groups of 30 students registered for the 
Statistics 101 course. The first day of the course we ask each student the
overall SAT grade



Take a college class of 30 students registered for the Stats 101 course.
